# Identifying Special Matrices
When coding or solving data analysis problems, one problem that can  occur is if your code encounters a special matrix that isn't invertible,  or has an infinite number of eigenvectors, or similar. On other  occasions, for example where you are reducing dimensionality, that might  even be desirable!  So here you will write a code fragment that traps  for different types of special matrices before calling the python  inversion routine, and classifies the type of special case encountered.  As much as anything, this is to give  you a chance to give a Python coding exercise a  try out in order to build confidence before doing some longer examples  later.

# Gram-Schmidt Process
The Gram-Schmidt process is a method for constructing an orthonormal  basis of a space that a set of given vectors span. It can also be used  to determine the dimension of that space, which may be different than  the dimension of the vectors themselves or the number of vectors provided to span the space.

# Reflecting Bear
In this assessment, you shall use the knowledge you have gained in  changing basis to construct a matrix that performs a transformation that  is easy in a particular basis, but complicated in our starting basis. Namely we shall help Panda Bear determine what his reflection will look like in a mirror that he has placed at an angle.

# Page Rank

In this notebook, you'll build on your knowledge of eigenvectors and  eigenvalues by exploring the PageRank algorithm. The notebook is in two parts, the first is a worksheet to get you up to  speed with how the algorithm works - here we will look at a  micro-internet with fewer than 10 websites and see what it does and what  can go wrong. The second is an assessment which will test your application of  eigentheory to this problem by writing code and calculating the page  rank of a large network representing a sub-section of the internet.
